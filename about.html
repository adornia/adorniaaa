Welcome to Adornia! We're more than just a jewelry brand; we’re a passion project and a symbol of self-expression and style.

Founded by friends kadeejath Kubra and Lia Rose, Adornia is built on a love for handcrafted, unique pieces that let you shine in your own way. Each piece is designed and created by us with care, creativity, and attention to detail.

Our brand is about bringing together art, beauty, and individuality. We craft every piece by hand, pouring our love for design and jewelry-making into each item to give you something truly special. We’re inspired by you—our amazing customers—and we’re dedicated to making pieces that you’ll love wearing every day.
